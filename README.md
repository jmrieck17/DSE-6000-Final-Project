# DSE-6000-Final-Project

Use the Covid data sets that you worked with, in Assignment 1 and get additional data on two other dimensions of your choice like regional economic data(unemployment, etc..), other diseases, etc., from various open datasets and find any interesting insights with respect to COVID and the other data that you picked. Keep your data in your Google Cloud Storage and make the data publicly accessible so that anyone can successfully run your Colab file.

Requirements for this assignment:

In this project, you will form teams of at most 4 members

You should sufficiently clean your data with a minimum of 5 steps of cleaning. (2.5 points)

You will need to show at least 20 different types of correlations, frequencies, and/or relationships between various independent and dependent variables with meaningful plots of 5 different types. Explain your assumptions and your findings before and after every plot. Every plot should have a title and x/y axis should have legible labels without any label overlaps for full credit. Explain your assumptions and your findings before and after every plot. (10 points)

At least 3 queries, like using select, group by, segmentation, etc., which does not produce charts but will bring out some meaningful results that you can articulate (1.5 points)

You should have a final conclusion, high lighting the main insights that you were able to derive from your analysis. (1 point)

You can use Pandas, Hadoop, Spark, or any other tool that you learned in this course for this final analysis. You can use multiple tools also as required.

You will share the link to your colab file as deliverable. Please ensure that you make your file public.

If you also create a project on the talent website, you will receive 0.5 points extra credit.

You will present your findings in class on December 10th at 4 pm. Each team gets 

5-7 minutes for the presentation.
